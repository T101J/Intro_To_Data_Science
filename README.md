# Intro_To_Data_Science
* Scripts I wrote for challenges Siraj Raval made as an introduction to Data Science. Siraj teaches python by getting us to learn by coding, rather than being given bits of theory here and there. 

* Siraj released these on youtube for free, you can find the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2-dafEMk2A6QKz1mrk1uIGfHkC1zZ6UU)
