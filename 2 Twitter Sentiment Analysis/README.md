Twitter Sentiment Analysis Challenge for Learn Python for Data Science #2 by @Sirajology on Youtube 
<h1>Overview </h1>  
This is the code for the Twitter Sentiment Analyzer challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #2' by @Sirajology on YouTube. The code uses the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each Tweet. We'll be able to see how positive or negative each tweet is about whatever topic we choose, I chose tweets on the topic 'Paddy Jackson' as he has been getting a lot of attention in the media and people have mixed views on the situation he found himself in
<h1>Dependencies</h1>  
tweepy (http://www.tweepy.org/) textblob (https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) 
Install missing dependencies using pip  
<h1>Usage</h1>  
Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, run the script in terminal via  python (label of your script).py 
<h1>Challenge</h1> 
Instead of printing out each tweet, save each Tweet to a CSV file with an associated label. The label should be either 'Positive' or 'Negative'. You can define the sentiment polarity threshold yourself, whatever you think constitutes a tweet being positive/negative.
<h1>Credits</h1>  
This code is altered for my own sentiment analysis, Siraj Raval @llSourcell created the original code
